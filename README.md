# Python-File-Manager
This project is a File Manager based on *Python 3.8*. It was made by [Deepesha Burse](https://github.com/deepeshaburse) as a personal project. With this file manager, we can perform various function like opening files/folders, renaming them, deleting them (permanently or sending them to the recycle bin), copy and move files.

## Modules Used:
1. sys
2. os
3. shutil
4. send2trash

## Motivation
File Handling is a core concept in almost all programming languages. Hence, to strengthen my skills, I thought of making a file manager where I could apply the file handling concepts.

## Functions You Can Perform:
1. Delete files/folders permanently
2. Send files/folders to the Recycle Bin
3. Directly open folders
4. Expand Folders
5. Move files/folders to another location
6. Copy files/folders to another location
7. Rename files/folders
